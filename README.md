## Description

My motivation largely comes from my desire to be a successful web developer. When it gets difficult, because I can't seem to understand something, I look at my son and realise that I can't give up.
I build this project - not just for homework purposes - but to further build my understanding of coding and the multidisciplinary team that is; vsc, github, gitbash and slack.
I do not think it solves any problems but it was fun.
I learnt that getting my head around some concepts in coding is not easy but if I just stick with it, it starts clicking, and there are so many resources out there to help me.
